    "paragraph1": "I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I grew up in the Cypress area and went to Cy Falls High School where I played baseball. I grew up playing baseball all around the Houston area. I love Houston because of how diverse it is and there is so much to do. I could go fishing in the lakes north of Houston or in Galveston, Texas which was a short 45 minute drive away. Houston always had the bbq and my favorite place to go to is Harris County BBQ. I would also go see my Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park as often as I could."}
